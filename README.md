# When jit(byte code -> generated machinecode (assembly) code, named C )+ vm code + excute C is faster to be run than complied C/C++/rust/zig machinecode. 

Native code is not necessarily any faster than Java code. Where is your profile data showing that native code could run faster? 

Is AOT not what i am thinking? 

Complier optimization ...

(JVM is not full blown in native code)

Copilot, [ GPT 4o => by Azure OpenAI] claims:

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation in .NET, such as with .NET Native or the .NET Core/5+ AOT feature called `ReadyToRun` (R2R), is designed to improve startup performance and reduce the need for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation at runtime. However, even with AOT compilation, some .NET runtime code is typically still included in the executable.

### Key Points:

1. **ReadyToRun (R2R)**:
   - R2R compiles the Intermediate Language (IL) code into native code ahead of time, but it still includes metadata and some IL code in the executable. This allows for fallback to JIT compilation if necessary.
   - This approach optimizes startup performance while still maintaining some level of flexibility.

2. **.NET Native**:
   - .NET Native, used primarily for UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications, compiles the entire application to native code.
   - It includes parts of the .NET runtime that are necessary for execution, but much of the runtime functionality is directly compiled into the native executable.

3. **Full AOT Compilation**:
   - In scenarios where full AOT compilation is used (e.g., with Xamarin or Blazor WebAssembly), the entire application and necessary runtime components are compiled into native code or WebAssembly.
   - The resulting executable or WebAssembly module includes the runtime components required for execution, but it minimizes the presence of IL code.

### Summary:
Yes, even with AOT compilation in .NET, the resulting executable typically includes some .NET runtime code to ensure that the application can execute correctly. The extent of runtime code included depends on the specific AOT technology and configuration used.

If you have more specific questions or need help with a particular aspect of AOT in .NET, feel free to ask!
